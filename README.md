# Image-Captioning-with-Swin-Transformer-Encoder-and-BART-Decoder
This project implements an image captioning model by combining a Swin Transformer (Tiny) as the visual encoder with BART (Base) as the text decoder using Hugging Faceâ€™s VisionEncoderDecoderModel. The model is trained and evaluated on the Kag100 image captioning dataset.
